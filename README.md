# Portfolio - Rebecca Eng

## Summary
Welcome to my portfolio! I created this website to display projects that demonstrate my style and abilities as a web developer. I utlized the Bootstrap framework in conjunction with HTML and CSS to build my portfolio as a responsive site. By using a responsive layout, my portfolio renders well on a variety of devices, everthing from phones to tablets to computers. This website will continue to be updated as more projects become available to share.

## Features
* Express was used to create HTML routes that serve static HTML files for each page view
* The application is hosted and deployed on Heroku 
* Bootstrap was used to create the responsive layout of this website
    * The nav bar at the top of each page renders as a toggle button on smaller screens and as links on larger screens
    * Boxes and their content resize to fit the size of any screen

* The Bootstrap grid system was used to create a series of containers, rows, and columns in order to produce a responsive layout
    * The main section on each page is comprised of a container that holds row(s) and column(s)
    * The portfolio page contains rows, columns, sub-rows, and sub-columns in order to display the grid of images

* The AOS library is utilized to add animation to images and cards when a user scrolls

* A sticky footer was used to keep the footer at the bottom of the pages
